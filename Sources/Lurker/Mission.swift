// MARK: - Protocols

/// A specific, isolated task that can be run in the background.
///
/// Lurker uses Swift Concurrency and requires that any code you designate for
/// background execution conforms to `Sendable` (and is therefore thread-safe).

    /// `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` value in your app's Info.plist.

    /// The background task style, `MissionStyle`. Generally, this indicates the nature
    /// of the task and the expected run time.
    ///

    /// executed later in the background.

    ///   background task is initiated. Importantly, this includes the

    ///   system-termination.
    ///
    /// - returns: `true` if your code completes execution successfully, or `false` if
    ///   your code is unable to complete with success prior to the passed-in task's
    ///   expiration. For example, you may return `false` if you make a network call that
    ///   does not complete before the `taskInfo`'s `expirationHandler` is called.

    /// task. Return `nil` to indicate that the system may begin the task as soon as it
    /// determines is appropriate.

    ///   background task, or `nil` if the system may execute the task as soon as
    ///   appropriate.
